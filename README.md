# A Single-page Website using React Framework

- The webpage should be able to switch between light and dark mode using the button on the top right. 

- The webpage should be scrollable for when the browser window size is smaller. 

- The header that says “Please enter your name for a personalized experience:” also contains a textbox and a Submit button. When the user enters their name and presses Submit, this whole bar should be updated as shown below. <Name> should be the input that is received from the textbox. You should add a sanity check to this input so that no special characters or numbers will be accepted. In case of an incorrect input, the textbox should be emptied and Submit button should become red (to expect another input). 

- When “About Us” button is pressed, a new box should appear directly under the header. This box should push down personalized name bar and have the contents shown below. Also, the button should turn purple. If the is pressed again, the new box should become hidden, and button should turn back to blue. 

- The same situation as above should also apply to the “Contact Info” and “Location” buttons as well. The contents of the boxes of these buttons are shown below. These boxes should appear at the bottom of the webpage. Only extra feature here should apply when clicking one of these two buttons while the other is already showing its contents. In this case, the former is returned to its blue state and the newly clicked button should go into its purple state and show its contents.
